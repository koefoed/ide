The number of observations does not correspond to those in the article. Neither does the variables...?!

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p></p>
	<p>These visualizations are developed using the Firefox web browser.
	I have made some effort to only use functionality that is well supported by recent browsers.
	</p>

	<p>The visualizations presented here are for data exploration only &ndash; they do not take the place of statistical analyses.</p>
</section>

<section>
<!--	<h2>Materials and methods</h2> -->
	<h2>The Dataset</h2>

	<p><a href="fev.csv">The data used here</a> is obtained from the R package <code>isdals</code><span id="isdals-ref-1" class="reference isdals"></span>.
	The data was prepared using the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R program</a>; <a href="prepareData.R">source code</a> is available.
	</p>

	<p>The dataset contains 654 observations of	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Age in whole years (3 to 19 years),</li>
		<li>Forced Expiratory Volume in litres (method of measurement is unspecified),</li>
		<li>Height measured in inches <q cite="#cite_speizer1979">to the nearest one-half inch</q><span id="speizer1979-ref-1" class="reference speizer79"></span>; here converted to centimetres,</li>
		<li>Gender (zero-one coded in the source), and</li>
		<li><q cite="#cite_isdals">Exposure to smoking</q><span class="reference isdals"></span> (zero-one coded in the source).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>"Exposure to smoking" is not explained in the <code>isdals</code> package.
	In Speizer et. al. 1979 no exposure to smoking does <strong>not</strong> mean that the person has never smoked; <span class="reference speizer79">§Definitions of cigarette  smoking</span>.</p>

	<p>The source cited as the origin of the data<span class="reference speizer79"></span> includes observations of further variables such as a classification of household type, and several measures of forced vital capacity.</p>
	<p>It is not indicated in the <code>isdals</code> package which of the measures of forced vital capacity forms the basis of the forced expiratory volume reported.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, the number of observation, 654, does not match any of the sets reported by Speizer et. al. 1979 before, during, or after exclusion of households and children with incomplete responses.</p>

	<p>I am unable to verify that the data used here corresponds to that of the referenced work.</p>

	<div id='crossfilter_plots'>

			<p>Exposure to smoking:
			<span class='reset' style='visibility: hidden;'>(<a href="javascript:CF_reset('exposure');">Reset filter</a>) <!-- Current filter: <span class='filter'></span></span></p> -->

		<div id="cf_barchart-gender" style="width: 25%">
			<p>Gender:

		</div>

	<p><a href="javascript:CF_reset('all')">(Reset all filters)</a></p>

	</div>

	<p>The first one notices is that less than 10% of the participants in the study were exposed to smoking.
	This may not be enough to identify any difference &ndash; indeed, Speizer et. al. 1979 find very few statistically significant differences.
	</p>

	<p>It surprised me to see that <a href="javascript:CF_filter(null,null,null,'yes',null);">more girls than boys were exposed to smoking</a>. I expected that smoking was a boy-thing and that having parents that smoke was independent of gender.
	One also notes that only one child below the age of 10 was exposed to smoking. This is a little peculiar &ndash; did parents of 1979 quit smoking while their children were small?
	</p>

	<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly <a href="javascript:CF_filter(dc.filters.RangedFilter(4.5,5.8), null, null, null, null);">the largest forced expiratory volume</a> is found among the oldest and tallest boys, even if some of them are exposed to smoking.
	But within this group those <a href="javascript:CF_filter(dc.filters.RangedFilter(4.5,5.8), null, null, 'yes', null); dc.redrawAll();">exposed to smoking</a> have the lowest forced expiratory volume.
	</p>


	<!-- *** fev as a function of age *** -->
	<h3>Forced expiratory volume as a function of age</h3>
	<p>The forced expiratory volume increases as the children grow into adulthood; this makes it hard to separate out the difference among those exposed to smoking and those not exposed to smoking.
	A plot of the data as a function of age, as the one below, is needed for this.
	</p>

	<p>Here still there is no crystal clear separation between the two groups of children.
	Although, it appears children exposed to smoke may have a slower increase of forced expiratory volume as they grow.

	<!-- *** Discussion about PCA *** -->
	<h3>Principal component analysis</h3>
	<p>
		It could be quite interesting to make a three dimensional scatter plot of the first three principal components of a principal component analysis of the data where you could use the mouse the change the view.
	</p>
	<p>
		But only 0.1 percent of the variance is captured by the third principal component and 99.77% by the first two principal components, so there is not much use of a three dimensional visualization.
	</p>
	<p>
		Below the first two principal components are displayed.
		No clear separation between children exposed to smoking and those not can bee seen.

			<img src="pc2_on_pc1.png">
			<figcaption>A 2D plot of the first to principal components of a principal component analysis coloured by exposure to smoke.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</p>
	<p>Most of the smokers are located towards the right hand side of the plot.
	This is because the first principal component almost coincides with the height of the children.
	As shown above, only the oldest of the children in this sample are exposed to smoke and these children are also among the tallest.
